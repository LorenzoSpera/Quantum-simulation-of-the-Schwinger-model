# Quantum simulation of the Scwhinger model 
This project represents my first research exploration during my first days of my stay at **DESY** – the **Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron** – within the **Center for Quantum Technologies and Applications (CQTA)**. It reflects an early-stage, hands-on implementation aimed at investigating how modern quantum algorithms, specifically the **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)**, can be used to simulate non-trivial quantum field theories such as the **Schwinger Model**.

This simulation serves both as a learning foundation and as a stepping stone toward more complex quantum simulations of gauge theories and lattice field models. While the implementation remains a numerical and exploratory prototype, it illustrates how hybrid quantum-classical approaches can be leveraged for strongly interacting systems, even on today's limited quantum hardware.
